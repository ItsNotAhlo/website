    <h2>You wanna know about me?</h2>
    <p>
      There really isn't much to know about me honestly. My name is Ahlo, I'm 22 at the time of writing this. I have some interests in coding but ultimately want to do system administration as a job.
      I'm currently learning HTML, CSS and a bit of Docker/Docker-compose. I want to learn Python, Kubernetes and LaTeX for future projects. I'm big into self-hosting, servers and Linux.
      I use NixOS as my main operating system. I have my dots privated at the moment since they're pretty much just a bunch of pieces of other configs tied loosely together with duct tape. Eventually I'll sit down and re-work them.
      I'm transgender and my pronouns are <a href="https://en.pronouns.page/u/itsnotahlo">She/Her</a>. I'm neuro divergent sporting the wonderful combination of ADHD and Autism.
